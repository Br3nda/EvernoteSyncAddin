Project: Evernote Tomboy Addin
Author: Douglas V. Johnston

Description: Implements a SyncServer that connects with Evernote[1] and performs a two-way sync of notes.


Requirements:

(The following sounds like a lot, but it should take less than 5 minutes to get setup)

In order to use this test version of the adding, you need to have the Evernote API code and Thrift dll, the source can be obtained from:
http://www.evernote.com/about/developer/api/

Compile the c# thrift project by executing:
$ gmcs -recurse:'*.cs' -t:library -out:enthrift.dll
from the src/csharp of the evernote API.

You'll also need to sign up for an Evernote API key which you can get from the same page. After signing up for an  account you'll get a Consumer_key and a consumer_secret from Evernote. These values must be inserted into the EvernoteSyncServer.cs file near the top. 

Also note that Mono rejects all SSL certificates by default, and I have not overriden the policy with a custom Certificate, so if you're using Mono and use https, you'll need to add evernote's security certificate. See http://www.mono-project.com/FAQ:_Security for details.

Once you have the enthrift.dll, compile the plugin with:

$ gmcs -debug -out:EvernoteSyncService.dll.dll -target:library -pkg:tomboy-addins -r:Mono.Posix *.cs -resource:EvernoteSyncService.addin.xml

Under Windows or MonoDevelop, either create a solution and load the csproj, or Add into the existing Tomboy solution, and compile.


Using:

BACK UP YOUR TOMBOY NOTES!!

Once installed in the .tomboy/addins directory, enable in the Preferences->Add-ins menu, then select "Evernote" from the Synchronization menu. Enter in your evernote username and password (NOT your API keys) from THE SANDBOX SERVER. Your regualr Evernote account will not work until this is released for real.
